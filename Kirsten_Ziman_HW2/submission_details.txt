I added another convolutional layer with 128 filters so that the final neurons would have larger receptive fields on the original image, allowing for better semantic classification of the entire image. I also added pooling layers after each convolution + bn + relu to reduce computational intensity and to help the model generalize better to situations where key image properties appear in different image locations. This network results in a 61.78% validation accuracy.
