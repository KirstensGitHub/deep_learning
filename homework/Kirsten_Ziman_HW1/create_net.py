    Constructs a network based on the specifications passed as input arguments

    Arguments
    --------
    input_features: (integer) the number of input features
    hidden_units: (list) of length L where L is the number of hidden layers. hidden_units[i] denotes the
                        number of units at hidden layer i + 1 for i  = 0, ..., L - 1
    non_linearity: (list)  of length L. non_linearity[i] contains a string describing the type of non-linearity to use
                           hidden layer i + 1 for i = 0, ... L-1
    output_size: (integer), the number of units in the output layer
